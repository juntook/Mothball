# Progress

Milestones per SPEC §7. Each entry records what shipped and what still needs human verification.

## M0 — Engineering skeleton — DONE (2026-07-11)

Shipped:
- Repo structure per SPEC §8.1; SwiftPM package with `Core` (library), `cli` (`mothball` binary), `MothballApp` (SwiftUI shell) and `CoreTests`.
- Apache-2.0 LICENSE + NOTICE; SPDX headers on all sources; CLAUDE.md with hard constraints.
- Rule library seeds (§6) + JSON Schema + `scripts/validate-rules.sh` (schema + semantic checks, negative-tested).
- GitHub Actions CI: rule validation, localization sync check, build + test.
- i18n scaffold: String Catalogs (`App/Localizable.xcstrings`, `Sources/Core/Localizable.xcstrings`) as the source of truth; `scripts/gen-localizations.py` generates the checked-in `.lproj/Localizable.strings` bundled as resources; en + zh-Hans.
- Empty-shell app: `NavigationSplitView` with Projects/Tools/Runtime/Settings sidebar, localized placeholders.

Environment-driven decisions (documented deviations):
- Build machine has Command Line Tools only (no full Xcode). The CLT SDK cannot compile `.xcstrings` and lacks the `Testing`/`XCTest` modules, so:
  - `.xcstrings` remains authoritative but generated `.strings` files are checked in (CI enforces sync). Migrating back to direct catalog compilation is a no-op once builds happen in full Xcode.
  - `swift-testing` is declared as a test-only package dependency (Apple's own framework) so `swift test` runs everywhere.
- `Sources/Core/Resources/rules` is a symlink to the top-level `rules/` so rule JSON ships inside the Core bundle without duplication.

Needs human verification:
- App UI smoke test on a machine with full Xcode (`swift run MothballApp`, or the M6 app-bundle script): sidebar shows, and shows Chinese when system language is zh-Hans.
- CI green on GitHub after first push.

## M1 — Rule engine + disk scanner + Tools view — DONE (2026-07-11)

Shipped:
- `RuleLoader`: bundled rules + user overrides from `~/Library/Application Support/Mothball/rules/` (same id overrides built-in; broken user rules degrade to warnings). Load-time semantic validation mirrors CI (defense in depth for user rules).
- `PathExpansion`: `~` expansion; single-segment `*` globs (fnmatch, FNM_PERIOD); `..` and `**` rejected.
- `DirectorySizer`: fts(3) bulk traversal, allocated (physical) size, FTS_PHYSICAL (symlinks never followed), SF_DATALESS subtrees never descended (predicate unit-tested; flag not settable from userland), concurrent across top-level subdirectories.
- `DiskScanner`: progressive `AsyncStream` — items appear on discovery, sizes stream in after.
- `ToolDetection`: fixed binary candidate dirs (no PATH reliance), path/app detection.
- `Doctor` engine + Doctor window in the app (Developer menu, ⇧⌘D): per-target existence/readability/size.
- Tools view: grouped by rule, sorted by footprint, draft rules badged "Unverified", safety badges, monospaced-digit locale-aware sizes, progressive updates.
- `mothball` CLI: `rules`, `scan`, `detect`, `doctor`, `size <path>`.
- zh-Hans catalog entries for all seed-rule descriptions/hints (en falls back to rule JSON).

Measured on this machine (debug build):
- Real scan: 13 items, 5.47 GB total in 0.65 s.
- Synthetic 100 000-file tree sized in 0.16 s (SPEC target: 500 k files ≤ 60 s).

Needs human verification:
- Doctor-driven promotion of seed rules from `draft` to `verified` (SPEC marks this a manual acceptance step).
- Tools view visual check with system language zh-Hans.

## M2 — Cleanup executor + safety gate — DONE (2026-07-11)

Shipped (gate tests written first, per CLAUDE.md):
- `DeletionGate` — all six SPEC §5.6 rules, below the UI: immutable confirmed paths only; realpath-prefix containment (parent chain resolved, leaf symlink never followed); hard-rejects `/`, home itself, `..`, short paths, `/System`, system `/Library`; protected → no path to deletion; user_data → trash only; direct delete only behind the setting.
- `CleanupExecutor` — per-item gate check + injectable `FileRemover`; user_data trash failure aborts the run and skips the rest (abort-and-ask, never a direct-delete fallback); regenerable failures don't stop the run.
- `AuditLog` — JSONL at `~/Library/Logs/Mothball/operations.jsonl` (timestamp, rule, target, path, bytes, method, result), always English.
- `IgnoreList` — persisted at Application Support; ignored rows collapse and can't be selected.
- UI: tier-appropriate selection (regenerable pre-checked, user_data opt-in, protected shows a lock, no checkbox); preview sheet with per-item user_data confirmation; progress; results page with reclaimed total, per-item outcomes, and the fixed APFS-snapshot note; direct-delete setting with per-session first-use re-confirmation; Settings pane (toggle, audit-log reveal, ignored paths).
- 23 new tests: 15 gate rejection/acceptance branches, executor abort semantics, audit JSONL, ignore list round-trip. 54 total, all green.
- Real `FileManager.trashItem` round-trip verified on-machine (file landed in `~/.Trash`, restorable).

Needs human verification:
- Full sheet flow visually (en + zh-Hans), including the user_data highlight and confirm interaction.

## M3 — Project discovery + attribution — DONE (2026-07-11)

Shipped:
- `ProjectDiscovery`: BFS under configured code roots, depth ≤ 6, skips hidden/`node_modules`/`Library`/`.Trash`; 12 marker files; project roots never descended (outermost wins); exclusions supported. `ProjectActivity`: last git commit (fixed-path git candidates, no PATH) falling back to root mtime.
- `AttributionEngine`: evidence 1 (path containment, nearest root wins), 2 (process cwd — consumed in M4), 3 (compose labels — M5), 4 (dashed-absolute encoded buckets), 5 (bind mounts — M5). Case-insensitive (APFS default), realpath-normalized. Lossy dashed encoding decoded by comparing against known roots' encodings — dashes in project names ("my-app", "shop-admin") disambiguate correctly.
- `DiskScanner.discoverProjectItems`: projectGlobs matched per root, gated by guardFiles (stray `node_modules` without `package.json` excluded). `explodeEncodedTargets`: per-bucket items with inherited safety; unmatched buckets → unattributed. `scanAll` combines everything.
- Projects view (default home): cards with name/path/relative last-active/footprint/item count; detail grouped by kind with per-item attribution evidence; "Unattributed / Global" bucket last. Code-roots management in Settings (folder picker).
- `mothball projects <root>` CLI for on-machine verification.
- 16 new tests incl. the SPEC-mandated constructed tree (nested git, guardless node_modules, hidden/Library distractors, depth limit, Chinese + space paths). 70 total, green.

Verified on this machine: 13 projects discovered (incl. `回声`, `petne中文推广/assets/app-extract`); `~/.claude/projects` buckets attributed to the right projects including dot-containing paths (`ai.nvwork.com` → `-Users-…-ai-nvwork-com-upstream`) and child-session buckets (`…-Sourcebotics-site` → Sourcebotics).

Needs human verification:
- Projects view + detail visually (en/zh-Hans).

## M4 — Runtime detection — DONE (2026-07-11)

Shipped:
- `LibprocProcessProvider`: full SPEC §5.4 chain — `proc_listpids(PROC_UID_ONLY)` → `proc_pidinfo(PROC_PIDLISTFDS)` + `proc_pidfdinfo(PROC_PIDFDSOCKETINFO)` for LISTEN TCP ports → `proc_pidpath` → `proc_pidvnodepathinfo` (cwd) → `proc_pid_rusage` (memory) + `PROC_PIDTBSDINFO` (start time). Pure user-space, no privileges.
- `RuntimeScanner`: current-user only; kept when listening on TCP or cwd attributed to a project; system exclusion list from bundled `rules/system-exclusions.json`; excludes Mothball itself.
- `ServiceStopper`: (pid, startTime) verified before every signal (PID-reuse guard); SIGTERM → 5 s poll → `stillRunning` (UI offers Force Quit; SIGKILL never sent implicitly); force kill re-verifies again. Injectable provider/poll/grace for tests.
- Runtime view: table (ports, process+PID, project/cwd, memory, started), auto-refresh on entry + manual refresh, per-row Stop, force-quit confirmation dialog, stale-pid alert. Stop/kill operations audited to operations.jsonl.
- `mothball runtime [root]` and `mothball stop <pid>` CLI.
- 10 new tests (filtering, cwd attribution, graceful stop, no auto-SIGKILL, PID-reuse abort on both paths, signal failure). 80 total, green.

Verified on this machine: real `node` dev server on :3000 attributed to `回声`; a test server on :5199 discovered with correct cwd (etour) and stopped via `mothball stop` (SIGTERM, confirmed gone); rapportd and friends filtered out.

Needs human verification:
- Runtime table + force-quit dialog visually (en/zh-Hans).

## M5 — Container resources — DONE (2026-07-11)

Shipped:
- `DockerEnvironment`: fixed binary candidates (Homebrew/`/usr/local`/OrbStack/Docker.app — PATH never consulted), socket probing (Docker Desktop/OrbStack/Colima/`/var/run`), `DOCKER_HOST`, current-context endpoint, daemon liveness probe, Podman detection. Everything recorded in a diagnostics struct.
- `DockerClient`: shell-out with `--format json` (JSONL parsing), human-size parser (SI units), compose label extraction, dangling detection, volume dangling cross-reference, `system df`, bind-mount sources via `container inspect`. Actions: stop / rm / rmi / volume rm / builder prune — none pass force flags; volumes only ever removed singly.
- `ContainerResourceScanner`: SPEC §5.5 matrix — running/stopped containers (regenerable), dangling images (regenerable, one-click batch), tagged-unreferenced images (user_data, per-item confirm; images backing *any* container incl. stopped ones are never offered), volumes (protected display, strong single confirm, no batch), build cache (prune). Attribution: compose working_dir (evidence 3) → bind-mount source (evidence 5); volumes correlate through compose sibling containers.
- Runtime view now splits: process table on top, container resources below; daemon-down and no-binary empty-state cards (not errors); Podman notice row; all Docker operations audited.
- `mothball docker [root]` CLI.
- 13 new tests over canned CLI output recorded from a real engine. 93 total, green.

Verified on this machine (Colima): compose containers attributed correctly (`echo-pg` → `回声`, `aigw-*` → `ai-gateway`); dangling images, volumes and 13.4 GB build cache listed.

Needs human verification:
- SPEC acceptance names Docker Desktop AND OrbStack environments — this machine runs Colima (a third supported endpoint). Re-run `mothball docker` under Docker Desktop and OrbStack.
- Volume strong-confirm and tagged-image confirm dialogs visually.

## M6 — Onboarding + release infrastructure — DONE (2026-07-11)

Shipped:
- Onboarding (first launch): welcome (value + open-source/local/no-sudo statement) → code-roots picker (skippable) → Full Disk Access step with live status polling and a deep link to the settings pane → finish auto-starts the first scan.
- `FullDiskAccess` probe (Core): opendir on TCC-protected paths (`~/Library/Safari` et al.) → granted/denied/indeterminate; no private API. Persistent degraded-mode banner (`FDABanner`) above all views while denied (SPEC §5.8 — no silent-incomplete state).
- Sparkle 2 integrated ("Check for Updates…" in the app menu). Gracefully disabled in bare SwiftPM dev runs; active only inside a bundle with `SUFeedURL` (release.sh injects it).
- `scripts/release.sh`: SwiftPM release build → .app assembly (Info.plist, resource bundles, Sparkle.framework) → codesign (Developer ID via `CODESIGN_IDENTITY`, ad-hoc fallback) → dmg.
- `scripts/notarize.sh`: notarytool submit + staple + Gatekeeper assessment (keychain profile based).
- `scripts/homebrew/mothball.rb`: cask draft for the self-hosted tap (`juntook/homebrew-tap`); official homebrew/cask deferred until notability thresholds are met.
- README bilingual install section (brew + dmg + Sparkle + why-not-MAS).
- Build-environment workaround: this machine's sandbox stalls SwiftPM's binary-artifact downloader, so `scripts/fetch-sparkle.sh` + `MOTHBALL_LOCAL_SPARKLE=1` builds against a vendored (gitignored, checksum-verified) xcframework. CI and normal checkouts use the standard remote artifact.
- 3 FDA tests; 96 total, green.

Needs human verification (requires Xcode + Developer ID certificates — intentionally left for you):
- Run `scripts/release.sh` with `CODESIGN_IDENTITY` set, then `scripts/notarize.sh` — produce a notarized, Gatekeeper-passing dmg.
- Generate Sparkle EdDSA keys (`generate_keys`), set `SPARKLE_ED_KEY`, publish appcast.
- Create the `juntook/homebrew-tap` repo, copy the cask, fill the real sha256, test `brew install --cask juntook/tap/mothball` on a clean machine.
- Onboarding + FDA flow visually (en/zh-Hans), degraded banner with FDA revoked.

## M7 — V2 information architecture + new shell — DONE (2026-07-12)

Shipped:
- SPEC rewritten to V2 (same-anchor policy: §4.3, §5.1–§5.6, §5.8, §8.5, §9 keep their V1 meaning; code references stay valid). New sections: V2 IA (§5.7), S0–S3 presentation-layer risk scores (§4.4, M8), ports (§5.9), process metrics (§5.10), Homebrew services (§5.11), protection rules (§5.12), sessions (§5.13), menu bar (§5.14), notifications (§5.15), history view (§5.16), M7–M11 roadmap.
- App layer rebuilt on the V2 IA: sidebar Overview / Active Resources / Storage / Settings (⌘1–⌘3; Sessions and History intentionally absent until M10/M11 — no placeholder sections), sidebar footer (last scan, lifetime reclaimed, version, help link), toolbar scan (⌘R) + search field.
- Overview: greeting with running-resource count, four metric cards (running resources, active ports, dev memory, reclaimable space — all fed by existing Core scanners), prioritized "needs attention" list (docker daemon down, biggest reclaimables ≥ 1 GB, stale projects ≥ 90 days holding ≥ 500 MB), each row deep-links to its page. First launch auto-scans.
- Active Resources: Processes tab (former Runtime table) with row-selection inspector (detail grid, stop-impact note, stop/force-kill flow unchanged); Containers tab (running/stopped lifecycle kinds).
- Storage: Project Artifacts / Tool Caches / Docker tabs. Project rows open the cleanup-detail sheet (kind-grouped selectable items, per-project clean button); persistent bottom selection bar ("N selected · X reclaimable · Review & Clean…") — the mandatory §5.6 preview is the only path to execution, so the prototype's separate "Proceed" button is deliberately folded into review. Docker tab hosts the disk-weight kinds (dangling/tagged images, volumes, build cache, stopped containers).
- Settings regrouped per §5.7: General (direct delete), Scan Scope (roots + exclusions, newly exposed), Language & Region (System/中文/English), Privacy & Updates (Sparkle check + audit log), Advanced (Doctor entry + ignore list). Doctor stays a separate window, now reachable from Settings and the Developer menu.
- Onboarding rebuilt as the §5.8 two-page flow (welcome features + combined permissions page with live FDA status).
- In-app language override with immediate effect: explicit `<lang>.lproj` sub-bundle resolution for both App and Core catalogs (`CoreResources.bundle` accessor added to Core), plus `\.locale` environment injection for FormatStyles. No `AppleLanguages` mutation.
- Search: current-page filtering (processes, projects, tool caches) per SPEC §5.7; global search deferred to M11. ⌘K focuses the field on macOS 15+ (`searchFocused` API); the menu item is hidden on macOS 14.
- Strings: 81 keys added, 15 obsolete removed; en + zh-Hans complete; generated .strings in sync (`--check` green).
- 96 tests green; rule validation green; 12-second launch smoke test passed.

Needs human verification:
- Visual pass of every page in en and zh-Hans, plus the in-app language switch (per §8.5 acceptance hook).
- Cleanup flow end-to-end on real data in the new Storage UI (selection bar → preview → trash → result).
- Process inspector + stop/force-kill visually; container tabs under a running daemon.
- Onboarding two-page flow on a fresh user account (delete the `onboardingComplete` default to re-trigger).

## M8 — Ports view + process metrics + risk display layer — DONE (2026-07-12)

Shipped:
- `ProcessSnapshot`/`RunningService` gain `parentPID` and `cpuTimeNanos` (mach-time converted); CPU percentages come from differencing consecutive snapshots, sampled only while a runtime tab is visible (5 s loop bound to the view's task — idle means zero polling, SPEC §5.10/§9.11).
- Ports tab (SPEC §5.9): one row per listening port with protocol/process/project/uptime/memory/stop, "development ports only" filter (hides the ephemeral range ≥ 49152), selection shares the process inspector.
- Process tree: outline table grouped by ppid when not searching; context menu "Stop Process Tree" stops depth-first children-before-parents; inspector shows child count and offers the tree stop.
- `RiskEngine` (SPEC §4.4): S0–S3 presentation scores — user_data/protected always S3; regenerable → S2 when the project has a running process or uncommitted changes, S1 when recently active or a global tool cache, S0 only with no activity signals. `GitStatusProbe` feeds the dirty signal (fixed-path git, nil-safe). 10 mapping-invariant tests.
- Risk badges with explanatory hover on every resource row (disk + container); default selection now skips S2+ items (tighten-only — enforcement unchanged).
- Overview attention list adds sustained-high-CPU and long-running-listener rows; list capped at 8.
- Window activation fix: bare `swift run` executables now front their window (activation policy set on appear).
- 106 tests green.

Needs human verification:
- CPU column values against Activity Monitor for a busy process.
- Port rows against `lsof -iTCP -sTCP:LISTEN` output.
- S2 badge appears for a project with a running dev server and its artifacts start unchecked.
